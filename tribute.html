        of Texas at Austin Edith Clarke (February 10, 1883 – October 29, 1959)
        was the first woman to be professionally employed as an electrical
        engineer in the United States, and the first female professor of
        electrical engineering in the country.She was the first woman to deliver
        a paper at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the first
        female engineer whose professional standing was recognized by Tau Beta
        Pi, and the first woman named as a Fellow of the American Institute of
        Electrical Engineers. She specialized in electrical power system
        analysis and wrote Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems

      <h3>Early life and education</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        One of nine children, Edith Clarke was born to lawyer John Ridgely
        Clarke and Susan Dorsey Owings on February 10, 1883, in Howard County,
        Maryland. After being orphaned at age 12, she was raised by an older
        sister. She used her inheritance to study mathematics and astronomy at
        Vassar College, where she graduated in 1908. After college, Clarke
        taught mathematics and physics at a private school in San Francisco and
        at Marshall College. She then spent some time studying civil engineering
        at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left to become a "computer"
        at AT&T in 1912. She computed for George Campbell, who applied
        mathematical methods to the problems of long-distance electrical
        transmissions. While at AT&T, she studied electrical engineering at
        Columbia University by night. In 1918, Clarke eProfessional career
        enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the following
        year she became the first woman to earn an M.S. in electrical
        engineering from MIT.Her thesis at MIT was supervised by Arthur E.
        Kennelly and was titled "Behavior of a lumpy artificial transmission
        line as the frequency is indefinitely increased."

      <h3>Professional career</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Unable to find work as an engineer, Clarke went to work for General
        Electric as a supervisor of computers in the Turbine Engineering
        Department. During this time, she invented the Clarke calculator,an
        early graphing calculator, a simple graphical device that solved
        equations involving electric current, voltage and impedance in power
        transmission lines. The device could solve line equatio ns involving
        hyperbolic functions ten times faster than previous methods. She filed a
        patent for the calculator in 1921 and it was granted in 1925.

        In 1921, Clarke took a leave of absence from GE to teach physics at the
        Constantinople Women's College in Turkey because she was not allowed to
        do electrical engineering work, was not earning the same salary and had
        a lower professional status as men doing the same work.The next year,
        when she returned from Turkey, she was offered a job by GE as a salaried
        electrical engineer in the Central Station Engineering Department – the
        first professional female electrical engineer in the United States. She
        retired from General Electric in 1945.

        Her background in mathematics helped her achieve fame in her field. On
        February 8, 1926, as the first woman to deliver a paper at the American
        Institute of Electrical Engineers' (AIEE) annual meeting, she showed the
        use of hyperbolic functions for calculating the maximum power that a
        line could carry without instability.The paper was of importance because
        transmission lines were getting longer, leading to greater loads and
        more chances for system instability, and Clarke's paper provided a model
        that applied to large systems.Two of her later papers won awards from
        the AIEE: the Best Regional Paper Prize in 1932 and the Best National
        Paper Prize in 1941.

        She also worked on the design and building of hydroelectric dams in the
        West Hoover Dam, contributing her electrical expertise to develop and
        install the turbines that generate hydropower there to this day.

        In 1943, Clarke wrote an influential textbook in the field of power
        engineering, Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems, based on her notes
        for lectures to GE engineers. This two-volume textbook teaches about her
        adaption of the symmetrical components system, in which she became
        interested while working for the second time at GE. This system is a
        mathematical means for engineers to study and solve problems of power
        system losses and the performance of electrical equipment. Clarke
        adopted this system to the three-phase components that are the basis of
        the electrical grid in the United States. This textbook was used as the
        basis of education for electrical engineers for many years.
